# Mordheim Companion App
This App will act as a companion to the Tabletop game Mordheim. The goal is for me to lean how to create a mobile app I can use to help learn how to play Mordheim without taking too much interaction away from the player, whilst also informing them of all their options.

## The Premise
This app will allow the user to select what faction they want and build their company. When building the company this app will tell the user what items can be attached (cost and their effects)

During the game the user can select a unit and it will display all the actions they can take including the effects of any items attached

The user can then add how much gold is added to their company after a battle and use the shop to buy more attachments or units

The user may have multiple armies and use a QR code to view another players army
